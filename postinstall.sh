# <OK> This was ok!"
# <INFO> This is just for your information."
# <WARNING> This is a warning!"
# <ERROR> This is an error!"
# <FAIL> This is a fail!"

# To use important variables from command line use the following code:
ARGV0=$0 # Zero argument is shell command
#echo "<INFO> Command is: $ARGV0"

ARGV1=$1 # First argument is temp folder during install
#echo "<INFO> Temporary folder is: $ARGV1"

ARGV2=$2 # Second argument is Plugin-Name for scipts etc.
#echo "<INFO> (Short) Name is: $ARGV2"

ARGV3=$3 # Third argument is Plugin installation folder
#echo "<INFO> Installation folder is: $ARGV3"

ARGV4=$4 # Forth argument is Plugin version
#echo "<INFO> Installation folder is: $ARGV4"

ARGV5=$5 # Fifth argument is Base folder of LoxBerry
